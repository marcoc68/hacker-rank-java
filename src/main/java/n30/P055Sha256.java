Cryptographic hash functions are mathematical operations run on digital data;
by comparing the computed hash (i.e., the output produced by executing a hashing algorithm)
to a known and expected hash value, a person can determine the data's integrity.
For example, computing the hash of a downloaded file and comparing the result to a previously
published hash result can show whether the download has been modified or tampered with.
In addition, cryptographic hash functions are extremely collision-resistant; in other words,
it should be extremely difficult to produce the same hash output from two different input values
using a cryptographic hash function.

Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the National
Security Agency (NSA). It consists of six identical hashing algorithms (i.e., SHA-256, SHA-512,
SHA-224, SHA-384, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256) with a variable digest size.
SHA-256 is a 256-bit (32 byte) hashing algorithm which can calculate a hash code for an
input of up to 256-1 bits. It undergoes 64 rounds of hashing and calculates a hash code that is
a 64-digit hexadecimal number.

Given a string, s, print its SHA-256 hash value.

Input Format:
A single alphanumeric string denoting s.

Constraints
String s consist of English alphabetic letters (i.e., |a-zA-Z|) and/or
decimal digits (i.e., 0 through 9) only.

Output Format
Print the SHA-256 encryption value of s on a new line.
